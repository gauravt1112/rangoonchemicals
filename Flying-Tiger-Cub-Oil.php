	<h1>Flying Tiger Cub Oil</h1>
	<p>This product is highly efficient in treating a number of troubles. The
application of a few drops on the chest, forehead, nose tip or on a handkerchief can 
drive away a cold and headache. It can further be used during influenza, toothache,
and muscular pain and to remedy itching caused due to insect bites. If a couple of 
drops are applied to a handkerchief, it can be used as an inhaler too. The effective 
emulsion possesses a pleasant fragrance and can also be used as a Liquid Balm. 
Children as well as adults can use it. This ayurvedic formula works not as an 
oil to relieve influenza, toothaches, muscular pain and insect bites.</p>

	<span>Working</span>
	<p>The warmth provided by the oil, helps to loosen up stiff and sore muscles.
When applied to the skin, the productâ€™s invigorating properties create heat under 
the skin, which boosts blood flow and circulation. The skin absorbs it rapidly, making 
the area numb and augmenting blood circulation. Acting as a relaxant, it relieves one 
of muscle pains. Due the presence of menthol, when directly applied to chest, it 
provides relief from cold and congestion. The strong aroma helps clear sinuses 
relieving one of breathing troubles. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties
of the oil help in relaxing sore muscles.</p>
<span>Usage</span>
<p>Apply Oil, prior to exercise, to arms and legs. Exercise as illustrated on the
leaflet provided, to increase elasticity. Make sure your muscles do not cool down 
again after warming up! After the match or training session, limber down with the 
same exercises in reverse order followed by applying Flying Tiger Cub Oil.</p>
	<span>Precautions</span>
	<p>1. Do not apply to tender parts of the body.<br>
2. Unadvisable for children under the age of 7 years.<br>
3. Do not massage into skin. Gently apply to affected areas.<br> 
4. Take precautions while applying close to sensitive regions like eyes, etc.

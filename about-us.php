	<div id="about-heading">Our History</div>
	<div id="about-content">In 1964, after the Military Raj begun ruling Burma, Indians were asked 

to migrate to their motherland. Mr. Yacoob Cassim Bham, Mr. Ahmed 

Adam Mulla, Mr. Gaman Mandalywala and Mr. Ismail Cassim Bham, 

migrated from Myanmar (Burma), after experiencing a toilsome 

struggle and conceived the idea to set up Rangoon Chemical Works. 

The co-founders funded RCW and we found our humble beginnings. 

Since then, we have been making strides in the field of Ayurveda 

(Balm) Medicine growing into a major pharmaceutical company in the 

last 50 years. We have established ourselves as an institution for 

generating products that heal and remedy a wide range of pains and 

aches. <br><br>

Using exclusive ingredients formulated to derive oils and ointments, 

which are internationally accepted & incredibly safe to use, we have 

created a range of products to aid and heal a number of afflictions.  

Our products remedy an array of ailments like the common cold, 

headache, backache, joint muscular pain, chest congestion, stiff neck 

and joints, ankylosing, spondylitis, rheumatic and osteoarthritic pain. 

Our products, Flying Tiger Cub Balm, Flying Tiger Cub Oil and our 

premium quality products such as Flying Peacock Balm and Oil prove 

to be effective antidotes for these afflictions.</div>
